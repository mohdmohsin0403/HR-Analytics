# HR-Analytics

This case study aims to model the probability of attrition of each employee from the HR Analytics Dataset, available on Kaggle. Its conclusions will allow the management to understand which factors urge the employees to leave the company and which changes should be made to avoid their departure.

This model will allow the company to calculate the probability of an employee to leave the company and to act on key-factors to avoid departures. The satisfaction of employees and the amount of workload they have to bear seem to be important causes of withdrawals. A particular attention on the work-life balance would be crucial to improve the turnover rate.
